# Neural-Network
This project involves building a neural network using Python and relevant libraries. The process includes designing the network architecture, training it on a given dataset, and testing its performance. Furthermore, the project explores methods for assessing machine learning models and discusses strategies for deploying them effectively.
## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine for development and testing. Refer to the deployment section for details on running the project in a production environment
## Prerequisites
To get started, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
•	Python 3.x
•	pandas
•	numpy
•	matplotlib
•	scikit-learn 
## Installation
Complete the setup by verifying that all tests pass successfully.

## Running the Tests
Learn how to execute automated tests for this project.

### End-to-End Testing
These tests validate the entire workflow, including:

1. Data preprocessing.
Model initialization and training.
2. Performance evaluation.
Model initialization and training.
3. Performance evaluation.


##### Run the following command to execute the tests:

python test_script.py  
Code Style Testing
Ensure the code adheres to 


##### Python standards and conventions using:

flake8 <project_directory>  
This checks for compliance with PEP 8 and provides suggestions for improvements.


### Deployment
To deploy the model in a live environment:

##### Train and Save the Model:
python train.py --save_model  
##### Serve the Model via a Web Framework: 
Use Flask or FastAPI.
python app.py  
##### Access the API: 
Interact with the model through a browser or tools like Postman.
